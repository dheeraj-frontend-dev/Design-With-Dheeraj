## 📂 My Projects
Here are a few projects I've worked on:

### [Project 1 - ([NexaLearn Academy!](https://nexa-learn.netlify.app/))]
I have put this project on first priority because I have enjoyed making this project a lot. This is an education academy related website which provides multiple trendy human skill courses. It took me 5 to 6 months to complete this website because I did it myself from design to development.
